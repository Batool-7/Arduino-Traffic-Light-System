# ðŸš¦ Arduino Traffic Light System

This project simulates a basic traffic light using three LEDs: Red, Yellow, and Green.

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works
- Green LED turns on for 5 seconds  
- Yellow LED turns on for 1 second  
- Red LED turns on for 5 seconds  
- Then the cycle repeats

---

## ðŸ§° Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs  
- 220Î© resistors (x3)  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  

---

## ðŸ’» Code

in a file called code
---

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned
- How to control multiple LEDs using Arduino  
- Timing and sequencing with `delay()`  
- Basic simulation of real-world traffic systems
